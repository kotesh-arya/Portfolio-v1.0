        <h1 style="text-align: left;"> The main benefits of using GitHub</h1>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;">1. It makes it easy to contribute to your open source projects</h3>
        <p style="text-align: left">To be honest, nearly every open-source project uses GitHub to manage their project. Using GitHub is free if your project is open source and includes a wiki and issue tracker that makes it easy to include more in-depth documentation and get feedback about your project. If you want to contribute, you just fork a project, make your changes and then send them a pull request using GitHub web interface.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;">2. Documentation</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">By using GitHub, you make  it easier to get excellent documentation. Their help section and guides have articles for nearly any topic related to git that you can think of.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">3. Markdown</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Markdown allows you to use a simple text editor to write formatted documents. GitHub has revolutionized writing by channeling everything through Markdown: from the issue tracker, user comments, everything. With so many other programming languages to learn for setting up projects, itâ€™s really a big benefit to have your content inputted in a format without having to learn yet another system.</p>
